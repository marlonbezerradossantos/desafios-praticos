I've<br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</h2>

            <h2 class="testimonial__coment testimonial__coment--black">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming<br> step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a<br> former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The Entire curriculum and staff dis not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanfing. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have in fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land job as full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</h2>

            <h2 class="testimonial__coment">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</h2>

            <h2 class="testimonial__coment">"Before joining the bootcamp, I1ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. Entire curriculum and staff dis not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanfing. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have in fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land job as full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</h2>
